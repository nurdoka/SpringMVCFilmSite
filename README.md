# SpringMVCFilmSite

# Description

This web application provides users with the ability to search and view details of films from a database. The application is built to fulfill the following user stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to enter a Film's ID and view all of its properties, including the name of its language, in a web page. If the film is not found, I should see an appropriate message.

* As a user, I want to enter a keyword and see a list of films containing that search term in either the title or description.

* As a user, when viewing a list of search results, I want to click on the film title to see the detailed information of that film. (Note: Reusing the controller request mapping and corresponding JSP view from the ID search.)

* As a user, when I view the details of a film, I want to see a list of its actors and categories.
